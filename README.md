# NASA Spacestagram

This project is a part of **Shopify Internship Winter 2022 Challenge**

## The Challenge
We need a webpage that can pull images, and allow the user to “like” and “unlike” their favourite images.

We'd like a simple to use interface that makes it easy to:
- [x] Fetch data from one of NASA’s APIs and display the resulting images (more details under Technical Requirements)
- [x] Display descriptive data for each image (for example: title, date, description, etc.)
- [x] Like an image
- [x] Unlike an image

## Extra
- [x] Animate the “like” action (might we suggest a heart?)

## Demo
